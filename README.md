## Instructions — How to play

**Goal:** Combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers. Reach **2048** to win!

**Controls**
- Use **Arrow keys** or **W / A / S / D** to move tiles up / left / down / right.
- Each move slides all tiles in the chosen direction. When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one tile with their sum.
- After every valid move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell.

**Winning**
- You win when a tile reaches **2048**. After winning you may continue to try for higher scores.

**Losing**
- The game ends when no valid moves remain (no empty cell and no adjacent equal tiles).

**Tips & Strategy**
- Keep your highest tile in one corner (e.g., bottom-right).
- Try to avoid moves that break your number order or move the highest tile out of the corner.
- Plan ahead — don’t make random moves; each move spawns a new tile that can block you.
